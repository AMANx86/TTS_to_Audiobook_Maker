# EPUB to TXT Converter

This Python script converts an EPUB ebook into a plain text (.txt) file, extracting and organizing chapters for easy reading or further processing.

## Features

- Reads an EPUB file and extracts all text content.
- Organizes output by chapter.
- Outputs a single `.txt` file, named after the original EPUB.
- Displays completion status and chapter count.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [ebooklib](https://pypi.org/project/EbookLib/)
- [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install ebooklib beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage

1. Place your target EPUB file (e.g., `Lord of Mysteries - Book 1.epub`) in the same directory as `epub_to_pdf.py`.
2. Edit the script (last line) if you want to convert a different EPUB file:
   ```python
   convert_epub_to_txt("YourBook.epub")
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python epub_to_pdf.py
   ```

The script will generate `YourBook.txt` in the same directory, with each chapter separated and labeled.

## Example Output

```
--- Chapter 1 ---
[Chapter 1 text here]

--- Chapter 2 ---
[Chapter 2 text here]
...
```

## Notes

- Only extracts text content; images, formatting, and special elements are not preserved.
- Make sure the EPUB file exists in the scriptâ€™s directory.
