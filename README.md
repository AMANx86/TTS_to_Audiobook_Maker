#audiobookmaker.py
-when used will turn everything in the (chapters)- folder into a audio files the generated audio file will look like 
chapter_0001.mp3
chapter_0002.mp3
etc.
the stuff inside the chapters folder will need to be in .txt format
special note it uses parallel processing and it can be adjusted by changing the variable (MAX PARALLEL)

the files that will be made will be put into a file called "LOTM Audiobook"
just rename it to whatever you want

# EPUB to TXT Converter

This Python script converts an EPUB ebook into a plain text (.txt) file, extracting and organizing chapters for easy reading or further processing.

## Features

- Reads an EPUB file and extracts all text content.
- Organizes output by chapter.
- Outputs a single `.txt` file, named after the original EPUB.
- Displays completion status and chapter count.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [ebooklib](https://pypi.org/project/EbookLib/)
- [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install ebooklib beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage

1. Place your target EPUB file (e.g., `Lord of Mysteries - Book 1.epub`) in the same directory as `epub_to_pdf.py`.
2. Edit the script (last line) if you want to convert a different EPUB file:
   ```python
   convert_epub_to_txt("YourBook.epub")
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python epub_to_pdf.py
   ```

The script will generate `YourBook.txt` in the same directory, with each chapter separated and labeled.

## Example Output

```
--- Chapter 1 ---
[Chapter 1 text here]

--- Chapter 2 ---
[Chapter 2 text here]
...
```

## Notes

- Only extracts text content; images, formatting, and special elements are not preserved.
- Make sure the EPUB file exists in the scriptâ€™s directory.
