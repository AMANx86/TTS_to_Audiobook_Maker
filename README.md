# TTS-
This repo is for my exp in generating audiobook using tts like edge tts

#audiobookmaker.py
-when used will turn everything in the (chapters)- folder into a audio files the generated audio file will look like 
chapter_0001.mp3
chapter_0002.mp3
etc.
the stuff inside the chapters folder will need to be in .txt format

#check_files.py
-this will list out all the files in chapters folder it will also mean if this file works then the audiobookmaker.py will also work fine
